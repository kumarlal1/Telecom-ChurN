# Telecom-Churn-

In this project, we will analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm,  build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and  identify the main indicators of churn.
	After identifying important predictors, display them visually â€“ we will use  plots, summary tables etc. - whatever you think best conveys the importance  of features.
recommend strategies to manage customer churn based on your  observations.

Recommendations

Target the customers, whose minutes of usage of the incoming local calls and outgoing ISD calls are less in
the action phase (mostly in the month of August).
Target the customers, whose outgoing others charge in July and incoming others on August are less.
Also, the customers having value based cost in the action phase increased are more likely to churn than the
other customers. Hence, these customers may be a good target to provide offer.  4.Cutomers, whose monthly 3G recharge in August is more, are likely to be churned.
Customers having decreasing STD incoming minutes of usage for operators T to fixed lines of T for the
month of August are more likely to churn.
Cutomers decreasing monthly 2g usage for August are most probable to churn.
Customers having decreasing incoming minutes of usage for operators T to fixed lines of T for August are  more likely to churn.
roam_og_mou_8 variables have positive coefficients (0.7135). That means for the customers, whose  roaming outgoing minutes of usage is increasing are more likely to churn.
